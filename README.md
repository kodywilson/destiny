**Destiny is a role playing game featuring four unique classes with character development and amazing dungeon fun!**

## Current Features:

1. Four character roles, Knight, Wizard, Cleric, and Rogue.
2. Rest at the tavern to restore health and mana.
3. Dungeon exploration with random encounters.
4. Simple combat is now in the game! Use magic or brawn to win glory!

## Role Descriptions

1. The Knight has the highest armor, strength, and health points of all the classes.
2. The Wizard can cast damaging spells and have a familiar to help protect them.
3. The Cleric can call upon higher powers to restore health during combat.
4. The Rogue, good melee damage and the highest dodge plus other roguish traits. ;-)

## Contributing to destiny
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
